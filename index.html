      <h4>About Me</h4>
      <p>Hello. I am Sumia Hoque Nova.
         I am a student of Independent University Bangladesh.
         <p>I am majoring in MIS. I am FROM Cumilla & currently living in Dhaka.</p>
         <p>I like to be positive about every aspect of life. There are many things I like to do, to see, and to experience.</p>

      <h1>Traveling</h1>
      <p>Travel takes us out of our comfort zones and inspires us to see, taste and try new things. It constantly challenges us, not only to adapt to and explore new surroundings, but also to engage with different people, to embrace adventures as they come and to share new and meaningful experiences with friends and loved ones.</p>

      <h1>Painting</h1>
        <p>Painting can be very relaxing and calming. I enjoy painting because it is one of the few things I am good at and can be proud about. Paintings, like many forms of art, can express ideas and feelings. Painting is a good way to escape from the real world and take a break from everything going on in life.</p>

       <h1>Gardening</h1>
       <p>Gardening works wonders for your physical health and it also helps to improve your mental well-being. When you garden you make things grow, you create food and you transform spaces. Gardening acts like therapy when I'm upset or just need to chill out from a stressful day.</p>
